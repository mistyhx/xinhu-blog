###Description

QuEra is a quantum computing company founded by MIT and Harvard researchers and professors. I was tasked to make their 
official website. They do not want to reveal too much information on the website, yet they still want to convey the core concept of their work.
I used some particles to simulate the process of quantum physics using tweezers. The cursor will change to either blue or
red tweezers depending on different simulation.
