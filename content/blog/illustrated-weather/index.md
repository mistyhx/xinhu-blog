[Try App](https://illustrated-weather.vercel.app/)

I have built a series of mini apps to combine art with engineering. 
These are my original creations that does not rely UI libraries. 

The illustrated weather app get local weather by getting the user's location and fetch from
weathers API and displays an illustration of mine based on the weather status.
