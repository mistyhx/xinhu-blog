### Description
This is a mini mobile web riddle game, that I created for Chinese Valentine's day - QIXI. 

I get inspired by the Chinese fairytale of LiuLang who traveled to the celestial palace to meet his lover Zhinv. 

I initialized this idea of helping the couple to meet and travel with Liulang from the ground up to the sky while
answering ancient poetry style chinese riddles and enjoy the beautiful view. Then, I invited 2 writers and 1 artist to the 
project.

This is a 100% original piece by me and other 3 team members. We did not copy or use any other code, riddle or illustration.
