## Introduction

Gatsby and Netlify CMS work perfectly together to create high performance and fast speed static websites. This article is a tutorial on how to build a blog with these technologies from scratch.

## Switching from templates platforms to Gatsby

In the past I have used platforms such as Wordpress and SquareSpace to host my portfolio website. Both are very handy tools when I was looking for something visual and easy to use. However, as I am seeking more and more flexibility and creativity, I kept injecting Javascript code to the site, thus making it very slow. Beside, all these platforms wraps my website with tons of layers, therefore the performance was diminished. It was acceptable to access the site from US, where I host it. However, it could even a minute to just get the first print, if I try to open it from another country. Therefore, I decided to build a **high performance** using the trending Gatsby framework.
