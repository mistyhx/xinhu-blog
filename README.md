# XIN HU BLOG

## Introduction

I created this simple blog with gatsby to record my thoughts.

## Development Mode

To run the app locally
`gatsby develop`

## Learning

1. Images could be loaded using graphql lazy loading instead of pass the data from parent
2. Components need to be wrapped in the static query component, while templates and pages can directly use the graphql API
3. Need the transformer plugin to parse image path markdown files.
4. You must at least one markdown file, or one markdown file with image to use allMarkdown and featured image
